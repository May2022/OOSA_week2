# OOSA_week2
There is a repos for week2's work.
## findMinimum.py
This is a script with a function which finds the minimum within an array and there is  a test case in the main block ,which gives a random array of 100 numbers between 0 and 1 and the result will be the minimum number in the random array.
## import_learn.py
This is a script for import the minimum function within a sort algorithm.It makes a random array of 100 numbers between 0 and 1 to a sorted array.
## arg.py
This script adds a command line parser(argparse) allows you to easily give your own options when calculating a mean of the number you want of numbers in a random array.
## mybank.py
Practice using an object by adding to the bank account example.
## searchObject.py
1.Task1: Creating an instance of the “dataSorter()” class makes a numpy array of length “numb”.  
2.Task3: Using binary search to y find a threshold crossing in large array.
## main.py
1.Task2: Add a function to plot a linegraph of the sorted array (y axis) against array index (x axis).   
2.Task4: Import binary search from searchObject.py and add a method to plot the sorted array along with a line to show the crossing point found by a binary search.
